const socialist = "Capitalism must be replaced by socialism. We enter the field of political action determined to wage war against all other political parties, whether alleged labour or avowedly capitalist, and call upon the members of the working class of this country to muster under its banner to the end that a speedy termination may be wrought to the system which deprives them of the fruits of their labour, and that poverty may give place to comfort, privilege to equality, and slavery to freedom. Society as at present constituted is based upon the ownership of the means of living by the capitalist or master class, and the consequent enslavement of the working class, by whose labour alone wealth is produced. Common ownership means that society as a whole owns the means and instruments for distributing wealth. It also implies the democratic control of the means and instruments for producing and distributing wealth, for if everyone owns, then everyone must have equal right to control the means and instruments for producing and distributing wealth. The establishment of a system of society based upon the common ownership and democratic control of the means and instruments for producing and distributing wealth by and in the interest of the whole community. The horrors being inflicted upon workers by the economic crisis is because of capitalism. The capitalist system is based on production for profit and on greed rather than need. Bankers and speculators wreaking havoc over our lives. We stand for the socialist alternative to the dictatorship of the markets, with democratic public ownership of banks, of key sectors of the economy and industry, and a plan of the economy to provide for the needs of people. We, alongside the international socialist organisation that we are affiliated to, support and wherever possible, assist, the building of struggle and movements of the working class and all oppressed people across the globe to oppose austerity. We have a proud and long record of campaigning and fighting for the rights of working class people. We have supported and assisted countless workers struggles and strikes. Our members build an alternative to the right-wing leaders who for decades have been in deals with governments and the employers that have resulted in a huge shift in wealth away from the working class to the profits of big business and the super-rich. We believe there is a need for workers to reclaim the trade unions to transform them into democratic fighting trade unions who put the interests of working class people first. We believe that the economic, social and environmental problems of society are caused by capitalism. Poverty and inequality is caused by the capitalist system which puts profit before the needs of people. In a socialist society production would be planned to meet the needs of the majority and on a global scale socialism would be capable of eradicating poverty, end the causes of war and conflict and collectively use the resources of humanity to deal with global warming. The crisis-ridden and unjust nature of capitalism is being exposed. Increasingly people are questioning capitalism and are looking for an alternative to austerity, unemployment and craven politicians and right-wing political parties, of wealth distribution and political systems. We are committed to building an alternative that can unite the majority of people in a struggle for socialism and an end to austerity, inequality, injustice, oppression and the enriching of a tiny billionaire global elite, while the hopes, dreams and rights of the majority of humanity are trampled on by capitalism. We opposes neo-liberal policies, including the sell-off of natural resources, the privatisation public amenities, the destruction of the environment, the prioritisation of corporate profit above the environment, poor public health and labour conditions and standards, tax cuts for the rich and corporations. No to privatisation or a two-tier health system, but a comprehensive national health service which treats people according to medical need and not money. A fair taxation system to fund public services based on ability to pay. Meanwhile billions are being taken from working people and given to bankers, developers and international speculators and finance houses. We reject so-called solutions to the economic crises based on slashing public expenditure, welfare payments and workers’ pay and pensions. There can be no just or sustainable solution to the crisis based solely on the market. Instead we favour democratic and public control over resources so that social need is prioritised over profit. Tax the greedy not the needy. The problem is that most of the wealth is in the hands of a tiny super-rich minority. It is high time that the super-rich showed a little patriotism. We oppose plans to sell off state companies. Instead of emigration our people must be given the opportunity to serve their own country. We demand a reversal of all the cuts in social welfare and benefit payments. Reverse the cuts, defend public services. We say end the profiteering in health care. We stand for a properly funded and resourced public health system, free at the point of access and paid for through a progressive tax system. No privatisation of health services and end all subsidies to private care. We demand proper state funding for the education system, free for all from early childhood to university. It is time to stop copying failed private sector practices. We support a campaign by the trade unions to unionise all workers and demand the legal right to trade union recognition. Through public ownership and democratic planning, the economy can be redirected onto a sustainable path. We call for major investment in community facilities. Withdraw all anti-trade union and anti-strike legislation. Redistribute the nation’s wealth. Cancel all debts to the international finance institutions, and transform the banks and major corporations into publicly owned and democratically controlled utilities. Wealth must be taken off the billionaires and used to meet essential social needs. An emergency public works programme. Reverse all austerity measures and spending cuts. Pour billions into the economy to end unemployment and provide decent paying jobs, free and high quality health, housing, education and social services. We believe that the poverty and misery, the oppression and exploitation that marks our society is the result of control of the world’s wealth and productive resources by a tiny class that exploits the vast majority of society. This leads to humanity being crippled by the reality and ideology of capitalist society. The ideas that support this social system are those of competition and the rat race. This emancipation of the working class can only be achieved by the working class itself. In practice, common ownership will mean everybody having the right to participate in decisions on how global resources will be used. It means nobody being able to take personal control of resources, beyond their own personal possessions. Democratic control is therefore also essential to the meaning of socialism. Socialism will be a society in which everybody will have the right to participate in the social decisions that affect them. These decisions could be on a wide range of issues—one of the most important kinds of decision, for example, would be how to organise the production of goods and services. Production under socialism would be directly and solely for use. With the natural and technical resources of the world held in common and controlled democratically, the sole object of production would be to meet human needs. This would entail an end to buying, selling and money. Instead, we would take freely what we had communally produced. The old slogan of from each according to ability, to each according to needs would apply. In socialism, everybody would have free access to the goods and services designed to directly meet their needs and there need be no system of payment for the work that each individual contributes to producing them. All work would be on a voluntary basis. Producing for needs means that people would engage in work that has a direct usefulness. The satisfaction that this would provide, along with the increased opportunity to shape working patterns and conditions, would bring about new attitudes to work. In socialism, the only work that would need to be done would be that for directly meeting human needs. Indeed, interesting and pleasant work is itself a human need.The working class are paid to produce goods and services which are then sold for a profit. The profit is gained by the capitalist class because they can make more money selling what we have produced than we cost to buy on the labour market. In this sense, the working class are exploited by the capitalist class. The capitalists live off the profits they obtain from exploiting the working class while reinvesting some of their profits for the further accumulation of wealth."

const capitalist = "To eliminate the deficit we must continue to cut out wasteful spending and make government more efficient. We should not be piling up and passing on unaffordable levels of debt to the next generation. We will eliminate the deficit in a sensible and balanced way. We should be free to trade and cooperate whenever it is mutually beneficial. End income tax on the minimum wage, cut income taxes for middle earners, scrap inheritance tax, abolish corpotate tax and increase the transferable personal tax allowance for married couples and civil partners. Our approach to the economy revolves around restoring incentives for workers by cutting taxes. Bringing down taxes on working people at the bottom and in the middle ranges of the income scale is our priority. We will withdraw taxpayer and consumer subsidies for new wind turbines and solar photovoltaic arrays, while respecting existing contractual arrangements. Business rates are a great burden on business and especially so on small businesses. The inconvenient truth is that political union offers no advantages to trade although it may inhibit it. We will cut taxes and reduce the burden on business. People must be free to form their own contracts. We believe that respect for individual rights is the essential precondition for a free and prosperous world, that force and fraud must be banished from human relationships, and that only through freedom can peace and prosperity be realized. We seek to build a world where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways, without interference from government. Individuals should be free to make choices for themselves. A free and competitive market allocates resources in the most efficient manner. Each person has the right to offer goods and services to others on the free market. The only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights, resolve disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected, not curbing competition. All efforts by government to redistribute wealth or to control or manage trade are improper in a free society. Respect for property rights is fundamental to maintaining a free and prosperous society. Government should not incur debt, which burdens future generations without their consent. We oppose all forms of government subsidies and bailouts any special interest. Government should not compete with private enterprise. The state should stay outside of the lives of the citizens. We must recognize self-reliance is a virtue rather than a necessity. Taxation and has negative consequences that have a depressive economic effect on society. The spirit of entrepreneurial adventure necessary to lead and inspire progress is stifled at too many turns. We believe in helping entrepreneurs start and build their businesses. We support private business ownership and oppose ownership of businesses by governments. We believe there is excessive regulation of business activity. Government-owned businesses distort markets and the money tied up in government-owned businesses would be far more useful in the hands of the taxpayers to whom it actually belongs. Government ownership is the most obvious and dangerous form of intervention. The subtle and dangerous intervention of over-regulation has been increasing and is now at unprecedented levels. We believe that freedom is precious, that our freedom is not conferred by government, that government poses great risks to our freedom, and that the role of government is the defence of freedom. Industrial relations laws hurt employees and employers and cause unemployment and dependency. They only help union leaders, lawyers and bureaucrats. These rules stop businesses from offering jobs. This creates unemployment and underemployment as well as reducing the potential for people to find a job that is most rewarding for them. The idea that good work and good pay can be assured by government decree is a con peddled by lawyers, unions and government. The most pernicious feature of industrial relations law is the minimum wage. The minimum wage is a ban on low paid employment. Adults must be free to make their own decisions without interference by the government or requiring its approval. We believe there are too many laws, taxes, regulations and too much government in general. Each year the government introduces hundreds of new pieces of legislation and thousands of pages of regulations and spending programs. We believe that the best course is a low tax future. We believe that taxing income is perverse. It discourages us from working and saving, impedes investment, and imposes unnecessary costs on individuals and businesses. We believe that the government has no role in taxing resources. We believe in free trade and that import tariffs increase the cost of living. Your money should be left in your pocket. We will abolish all duties, tariffs, taxes and levies. We are committed to getting the Nanny State off our backs, out of our pockets and out of our lives. We will abolish the regulations and tax codes that hinder economic growth. Clear laws and protection of property rights will provide the environment for businesses to be created and to prosper. Education is far too important to be left in the hands of the government. Parents should have the right to choose the way their children are taught. We will remove the state from all involvement in medicine, allowing providers to compete in an open market. We will get the government’s agents out of your business, and cut the regulations that allow them access. We will give people greater choice and allow them the honour of taking greater responsibility in their lives. We advocate privately funded alternatives. We promote the participation of charities to perform more of the social roles and provide funding for those who are truly needy. We look to the day when free markets and charities fill the roles currently occupied by the state. When government prints money the increase in the money supply causes inflation that devalues the currency. We stand for free market economic policies, property rights and entrepreneurship. Government regulatory agencies do far more harm than good. These regulatory agencies hurt consumers by increasing costs and curbing competition."

const tolerance = "We would end the war on drugs by legalizing cannabis and immediately decriminalizing the consumption and possession of drugs. The war on drugs has cost tax payers billions in enforcement and incarceration of citizens who have harmed no one besides themselves. Drugs should be dealt with through harm reduction strategies, and as a matter of public health, not through the criminal justice system. The decriminalization of drugs ensures that organized criminals cannot profit from the drug trade. The State must not interfere with citizens' private lives. We must fight for democratic and other crucial rights, such as abortion and gay marriage rights. Our activists have also been vocal and active in campaigning for a woman’s right to choose. Women in our party have also established a group particularly for women to become active on and discuss vital issues of inequality and sexism from abortion rights, to rape culture and sexism in the mass media and popular culture. Freedom of speech is fundamental in a democratic society. Freedom of speech and expression should not be limited because the speech or expression is defamatory, offends, insults, humiliates or intimidates, because it is thought to be wrong, or because it is immoral, indecent, or contrary to community expectations. Freedom of speech and expression should only be limited under long-standing laws against aiding or inciting a crime or disturbing the peace. There should be no government filtering of the internet, and there should be no bans on movies except where depicting an actual crime, books or games for adults. Along with free speech, a free press is important for constraining government. There should be no constraint on owning any media organisation, radio spectrum should be auctioned without conditions, and no one should be required to reveal one’s sources. Restrictions on freedom of association, assembly and movement represent government over reach. Freedom of association should not be limited by bans on membership of gangs or groups deemed to be terrorist organisations. Freedom of association should not be limited by prohibitions on joining a trade union, nor on requirements to join one. Freedom to gather in public places without hindering the movement and peace of others should not be limited by curfews or laws against loitering and peaceful protests. Freedom over one’s body includes freedom to take one’s own life and to assist others to do so, to control one’s own fertility and to have children, to refuse medical treatment, to obtain one’s own medical records. We should be free from harassment, from physical harm, and we have a right to privacy, to our own thoughts, opinions and religion. Adults are not like children, who lack sufficient experience of life to make reasoned choices and cannot appreciate what it means to take responsibility for those choices. We do not need anyone to make our choices for us. We can choose where to live, which job to take, where to go on holiday and what to do with their money, and live with the consequences. We can choose our particular lifestyle including such things as how to live, whether to live alone or with others, and who to live with. Religion should be a personal matter, and should not be interfered with by the government. Marijuana prohibition causes far more problems than it solves and results in the needless arrest of hundreds of thousands of otherwise law abiding citizens each year. The personal possession, cultivation and use of cannabis by adults should be free from arrest and prosecution. Regulated cannabis commerce is to be established, similar to alcohol and tobacco, including licensed venues. All historical cannabis convictions should to be quashed with the opportunity to apply for compensation. Medicinal cannabis dispensaries are to be established and doctors are authorised to prescribe medical grade cannabis. Full-scale hemp production and utilisation should be enabled with a priority is to be given the production of biofuels from hemp. Opponents of gay marriage appear willing to do anything at all to stop it and the reason is that cultural, social, and political forces in are moving almost inexorably towards the legalization of gay marriage. Sooner or later, marriage for same-sex couples will be as legal and recognized as marriage has traditionally been for heterosexual couples. Major steps in this process have already occurred in other Western nations, and some minor steps are being made in this direction here. Opponents of gay marriage appear to recognize this they seem to realize that the cultural, social, and political forces are against them, without it being considered immoral. This is why they are so determined to enact laws, and perhaps even constitutional amendments, to prevent gay marriage from being recognized or legalized anywhere. Two-thirds of Irish people want abortion decriminalised, according to a survey that signals a major shift in views on a woman’s right to choose in a country that still outlaws most terminations. We support equality for all and the elimination of all forms of discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, disability or age. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal, as well. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students face discrimination and harassment at school all too often. Unfortunately, many school officials know very little about how the law requires them to protect gay students. Teachers will be equipped to tackle homophobic bullying, and we will introduce age-appropriate compulsory sex and relationship education in all State-supported schools so that young people learn to respect each other’s relationships. We shall form coalitions designed to solve problems of joint concern with racial and ethnic minorities and others who understand the interconnectedness of all struggles for equality. We shall build a close alliance with the Feminist Movement, with which we recognize a special kinship in goals. And we shall further economic and social justice for all people. We also expect politicians to take progressive stands on economic issues, on the rights of women, workers, and minorities, on protecting the environment, and on international affairs. We are in favour of gay rights and believe that people of all sexualities and genders should be treated equally and fairly. Everyone has the right to end his or her life voluntarily. All sex work and prostitution should be legalised as we must respect the rights of women over their own bodies. The right to choose to have an abortion is a fundamental human right. We should open our borders and welcome refugees with open arms. All drugs should be legalised. Everyone has the right to do what their want with their own body. We believe in separate church and state, and the freedom of religion. We want to build a society of kindness and compassion for all, whatever their creed, gender or sexuality. The right to marry should not be denied to gays. Gay couples must be allowed to adopt on an equal basis. We support a woman's right to choose her own reproductive destiny. We must work together to stamp all all forms of homophobia and sexual bullying. A woman's personal choices are her own and must not be interfered with. Terminally ill people should have the right to end their suffering with a quick, dignified, and compassionate death. The right of a competent, terminally ill person to avoid excruciating pain and embrace a timely and dignified death bears the sanction of history and is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Assisting death in no way precludes giving the best palliative care possible but rather integrates compassionate care and respect for the patient's autonomy and ultimately makes death with dignity a real option. Same-sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives. As the State itself makes marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation’s society. Same-sex couples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage and seek fulfilment in its highest meaning. Gay couples need access to civil marriage for the same reason that heterosexual couples need it. Surely we must live together with some degree of mutual acceptance. Regardless of how completely their lives are intertwined or how deeply they care for each other, individuals in same-sex relationships frequently are treated like strangers under the law — and none are afforded full equality. Same-sex marriages provide stability for couples in terms of public acknowledgement of their commitment and provide legitimacy for the children being raised by gay and lesbian parents. Nothing is more basic from a mental health perspective to happiness and liberty than the right to love another human being with the same privileges and responsibilities as everyone else. The evidence is overwhelming that marijuana can relieve certain types of pain, nausea, vomiting and other symptoms caused by such illnesses as multiple sclerosis, cancer and AIDS or by the harsh drugs sometimes used to treat them. And it can do so with remarkable safety. Indeed, marijuana is less toxic than many of the drugs that physicians prescribe every day. Although cannabis has been smoked widely in Western countries for more than four decades, there have been no reported cases of lung cancer or emphysema attributed to marijuana. While it is not possible with existing data to determine conclusively that state medical marijuana laws caused the documented declines in adolescent marijuana use, the overwhelming downward trend strongly suggests that the effect of state medical marijuana laws on teen marijuana use has been either neutral or positive, discouraging youthful experimentation with the drug. Access to safe and legal abortion is an important aspect of women’s health care. Women are moral agents. Women are capable of making soulful, moral decisions about their own bodies. Assuming that a woman cannot decide for herself if and when to bear a child demeans women. Mandatory childbearing makes the woman a hostage to the will of others those unfamiliar with her story, her life experience and her needs, and may have disastrous consequences for the children. Medical choices, like terminating a pregnancy, are medically available. Other life sustaining medical procedures are not considered immoral."

const nationalist = "One of the key tests of a state is its ability to protect its citizens. It is vital that our people feel safe and secure. No one should have to fear that their property or person will be unlawfully interfered with by criminals. We must restore public confidence in our justice system. We will restore Capital Punishment as an option for judges in extreme cases, such as child killers, crack-down on crime, with more police on the streets, implement zero tolerance for drug-dealers and violent thugs, tougher treatment of criminals, ensure a separation between mental health and criminal problems, introduce compulsory treatment for drug addicts who have committed crimes, invest in projects to prevent crime by better planning of neighbourhoods and products. Restore authority to teachers. Give our young people knowledge and pride of our history, traditions, identity and origins and cut the compulsory study of all other cultures. Mass immigration is the greatest threat to our precious and unique identity. The pressure on housing and on public services such as schools, hospitals, transport networks, welfare and social security is far too great. Our country is full and it’s time to shut the door. We will leave the EU and take back control of our borders, deport bogus asylum seekers and foreign criminals immediately, crack down on illegal immigration, no amnesty for illegal immigrants, crack down on sham marriages. These policies are essential if we are to give our country the breathing space it needs from mass uncontrolled immigration, and create harmonious, integrated communities. There will be no amnesty for illegal immigrants. We will increase the number of immigration compliance and enforcement teams and review current holding and accommodation arrangements for illegal immigrants. Our membership of the European Union and associated acceptance of the free movement of people principle means we are unable to prevent criminals arriving on our shores. Crimes have been committed here by foreign criminals with long records in their home countries and criminality has risen as gangs of criminals have arrived from overseas. By opening the borders to convicted criminals, previous governments have put us at unacceptable risk. Prisoners will not be given the vote. Those who have lost their right to liberty by committing a serious crime should also lose their ability to vote. Voting is a civic right, not a human right. We will introduce a fast-track deportation programme to safeguard our national security and ease overcrowding and pressure on our prison service. We will rebuild our Armed Forces and restore them to their rightful place in the world, able to react appropriately to any threat. Anybody arriving in the country should have no expectation of being supported by the State, subsidised housing or any benefits of any kind. Gun ownership harms no other person. The right to self defence precedes the authority of governments. In terms of crime control, gun laws are ineffective. Making gun ownership illegal does not stop gun ownership, it merely affects those gun owners who are law-abiding. Disarming the law-abiding is irrational when the lawless cannot be disarmed. Only armed citizens can deter violent crime before it starts, or to reduce its spread. A criminal is more likely to be driven off from a particular crime by an armed victim than to be convicted and imprisoned for it. Widespread gun ownership will make the community safer. As a result of these alarming predictions, can immigration control itself be enough to stop our displacement in our own land by foreigners? In places such as Israel, majority Jewish, and Saudi Arabia, overwhelmingly Muslim, steps are already being taken to prevent mass immigration by foreign workers and asylum seekers from changing those countries irrevocably from within and altering the demographic balance of those radically divergent nations. Recently, Switzerland narrowly voted to stop further immigration from neighbouring countries and revoked a treaty with the EU that opened its borders in 2002. Why can’t an island nation such as ours impose robust anti-immigration measures and also implement a comprehensive repatriation scheme that prevents the takeover of our towns and cities by foreigners? As demands for stricter immigration control grows across most of Europe, in order to protect wage levels and living standards amongst native workers, we must not forget that the nationalist demographic imperative to live amongst your own kind in a nation state of your own making is not negotiable. And if that applies to countries in the Middle East and beyond, including Africa and Asia, without complaint from our politically correct masters, then it must also be applied to the nations of Europe and the rest of the Western World as well. Islam will be the only major religion to increase faster than the world’s population over the next years. The religion's share of the world’s population will equal the Christian share at roughly 32 per cent each in 2070, analysis showed. The number of Muslims will increase at more than double the rate of the world's population, which is expected to rise by 35 per cent in the next four decades. Thousands of migrants from the Middle East on their way to Western Europe. With no border controls the migrants are free to travel across Europe and only a matter of time before large numbers reach France with the intention of gaining entry to the UK by whatever illegal means they can find. Multiculturalism has failed everywhere. It is negative and divisive, a weight that is drowning our once safe and cohesive society. We will abolish multiculturalism and promote assimilation, nationalism, loyalty and national pride. As a government policy, multi-racialism encompassed measures to destroy our culture. It played a large part in migrant selection in an attempt to prevent them from assimilating into our society. We intend to abolish multiculturalism as it is unconstitutional. We would replace it with a policy of assimilation in which it will be made clear to all those applying to migrate here that coming here is a privilege that gives them an overriding, unifying commitment to our nation, to its past, current interests and future first and foremost. Immigrants must accept the basic structures and principles of our heritage, society and culture. We wish to rebuild our communities and restore a sense of self esteem, self reliance, hope and celebration of our Western, European heritage to engender a sense of belonging and shared purpose. We reject the self hate, shame and guilt currently projected onto ourselves and taught to our children about the European identity and achievements. True diversity is a world of difference not a globe of people all with the same religion, same culture, same political system, same legal system, same morals and values, same ethnicity, same race and same ways of living. Nationalism ensures diversity in a sustainable, deeply genuine way as it promotes self determination, autonomy and independence for all the worlds peoples rather than forcing them to live together with the veneer that is multiculturalism providing a shallow skin deep nod to only one or two aspects of diversity like food or clothing. We believe that a responsible sense of national identity is necessary to allow all the peoples of the world to live in autonomy, independence and to live an existence in which they can preserve their unique identity, character and heritage. A nation is a living community in which its values and heritage are inseparable from the philosophy of its rulers and where the tools of politics and economics serve the cultural objectives of its people. As human beings we inherently want more than function and income. We want a place in a community, a culture that affirms the values we feel to be true and an organic base from which to build for a better future. A nation can only be legitimately defined from people with a pre-existing bond who recognise that a higher order nation exists among them and their way of life. Our conception of the nation uplifts the people, providing hope, and helping them see beyond purely selfish pursuits, as they are now part of a culture, working for the health of that entity as well as fulfilling their personal lives. We actively resist policies brought about by the practice of universalism, radical egalitarianism and human rights totalitarianism. For example, the policies of unlimited immigration, the undeniably massive flow of unwanted migration into nearly all Western nations, the suppression of free speech by Orwellian political correctness and associated censorship laws, the globalisation of the world’s cultures into one Mc Culture, collapsing of hundreds of spiritualities into one or two religions only, the imperial march of humanism and enforcement of the liberal democratic political system on peoples that reject it. To have a sensible immigration programme geared towards accepting people from culturally similar populations, who will readily accept our way of life and the inherent values, thus enabling a relatively quick, easy and low-cost assimilation into our society. End the destructiveness of multiculturalism and political correctness. Teach our students about the achievements and values of our society and of Western Civilisation. Immerse our youth in the traditions of our national identity and culture. Enable criticism and challenging of ideas in the classroom, but without having a black armband view of history deliberately being pushed by teachers as a form of political activism. End government funding for the political ideology of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is actually a political ideology, one that is anti-Western in nature, pluralist in concept, and divisive in practice. By its very nature, the ideology of multiculturalism undermines the culture of the host country, lacks moral direction due to its divided stance on cultural issues, and divides countries by its practice of pushing different parts of society into competing ethnic groups, creating a nation of tribes, instead of unifying people around the nation’s core culture. A particular problem within Western societies has been the growth of Islam, with Muslim militants attempting to push their way of life upon Western societies, including demands for Sharia Law. Islam encompasses political and social aspects that are not compatible with our way of life. As the Muslim population grows within a country, the influence of Islam intensifies at every level. Islamic immigration is a hand-in-glove component of Third World immigration. The major parties have deliberately changed the immigration policies so that immigration from the Third World now outweighs immigration from culturally compatible Western societies. In terms of maintaining social cohesion and national well-being, having massive Third World immigration is illogical, it is leading to the Third World colonisation of our country, which would mean an end to the very existence of our people and our way of life."
